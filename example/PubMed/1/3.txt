human: Describe the composition and the subjects in this picture.
gpt: This MRI image displays a sagittal view of the spine from a six-year-old child post-trauma. The image likely represents a fat suppression T1-weighted MRI, indicated by the enhanced contrast around adipose tissues and the visualization of the spinal structures. A significant feature visible in this image is a marked cystic-like formation located in the intradural-extramedullary space (identified by the blue arrow). This formation shows a fluid-fluid level, suggesting the presence of different densities within the cyst, possibly blood and cerebrospinal fluid, indicative of a post-traumatic pseudomeningocele. Additionally, there is evidence of spinal cord dislocation adjacent to the cyst, complicating the clinical picture. Also noticeable are signs of traumatic deformation manifesting as irregularities in the vertebral bodies above the cystic formation.
