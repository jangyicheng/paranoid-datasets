gpt: The image set presents multiple views related to a medical diagnosis and surgical procedure involving a clavicle region. Image 1 shows an X-ray of clavicle indicating a distinct bony anomaly near the midshaft of the right clavicle. Image 2 displays an ultrasound image with a hypoechoic mass adjacent to the clavicle, suggesting a soft-tissue component. Image 3 is another MRI view with an arrow indicating a lesion on the bone, visible as an irregularity in bone texture. Image 4 captures the surgical scene showing the exposed clavicle and the removed soft tissue mass, which appears semi-hemispherical and yellowish, typical of benign tumors. Image 5 is a microscopic view of the tissue, revealing fibrous structures and cellular morphology consistent with a benign lesion. The last image, an X-ray, shows the clavicle post-surgery, indicating the site of incision and removal of the lesion.
