gpt: The image shows a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the shoulder region. The scan reveals a 35 x 15 mm solid mass within the right deltoid muscle.

The surrounding muscle tissues and anatomical structures are visible, but the focus of the image is on the presence and characteristics of the intramuscular mass.
