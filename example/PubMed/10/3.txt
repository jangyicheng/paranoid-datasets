gpt: The image is a lateral radiograph of the knee, showing a detailed view of the bones that comprises the knee joint. The femur, tibia, fibula, and patella are visible with high clarity. Notably, within the patella, there is a well-defined lytic lesion situated dorsally and superiorly. This lesion appears as a localized area of increased radiolucency compared to the surrounding bone tissue, indicating a possible abnormality in the bone density and structure at this site.
