gpt: The image presents a comparative study of Vertebrobasilar Artery Dissecting Aneurysms (VBA-DAs) depicted through both 3D models and relevant imaging methods, specifically Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) and High Resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging (HR-MRI). Rows correspond to different types of aneurysms: classical, stenosis, spiral, and hemorrhagic. The top row (A1, B1, C1, D1) showcases colored 3D renderings of these aneurysms, highlighting features like intramural hematoma in A1 marked by an arrow. The second row (A2, B2, C2, D2) includes DSA images, which show blood vessel morphology and abnormalities such as proximal stenosis in B2. The third row (A3, B3, C3, D3) consists of HR-MRI images, detailing internal structures and providing high contrast views of pathological features like the crescent signal outside the vessel lumen in A3 indicating hematoma, and the varied position of hematoma in C3 reflecting the spiral type aneurysm.
