human: Write a description of the given image.
gpt: This MRI image is a coronal T1-weighted view displaying the right axillary region of a patient. The image highlights a large, well-defined mass that appears as multiple mottled, hypointense and hyperintense sections interspersed throughout the internal structure, indicating varied tissue densities within the tumor. This mass is consistent in appearance with a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST). The surrounding tissues show normal muscle and fat contrast, with clear demarcation from the abnormal mass. An arrow in the image points directly to the tumor, emphasizing the area of interest. The overall image quality is clear, providing precise visualization of the anatomical structures involved.
